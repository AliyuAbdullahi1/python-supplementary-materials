Step 1: Download the Music.csv Dataset
Download the Music.csv dataset from the provided link.
Step 2: Load and Inspect the Data
Use a Python library like Pandas to load the dataset and inspect its contents.
import pandas as pd
# Load the dataset
music_data = pd.read_csv('Music.csv')
# Inspect the dataset
print(music_data.head())
print(music_data.info())
print(music_data.describe())
Step 3: Clean or Prepare the Data
Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and perform any necessary data preprocessing.
# Remove duplicates
music_data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
# Handle missing values
music_data.fillna(music_data.mean(), inplace=True)
Step 4: Prepare the Data for Modeling
Split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y).
# Define features (X) and labels (y)
X = music_data.drop('label', axis=1)
y = music_data['label']
Step 5: Build and Train the Model
Use a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to build and train the model.


# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Step 6: Make Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
Step 7: Evaluate Model Accuracy
Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics like accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
Step 8: Take a Screenshot of the Final Predictions and Results
Take a screenshot of the final predictions and results, and insert it into a Google Slide.
